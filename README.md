# Object-Classification-using-CNN


Since AlexNet in 2012, the focus on Deep Learning for
Computer Vision, in general, has increased rapidly. Every
year new algorithms or models keep on outperforming
the previous ones in the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual
Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). Over the years, since
2012, the algorithms that won this challenge include- ZFNet
(2013), GoogLeNet (2014), VGGNet (2014), ResNet (2015),
DenseNet (2016), SENet (2017). At the core of each of these
algorithms is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In addition,
these architectures include several optimizations to solve
the challenges associated with object recognition, including viewpoint
variation, scale variation, intra-class variation, image
deformation, image occlusion, illumination conditions,
and background clutter. Drawing inspiration from the recent
advances in Object Recognition, we wanted to check the performance
of ResNet, VGGNet, Inception V3, and Xception
on a personally curated dataset. We have focused only on
Object Recognition, and we have handled the challenge of
viewpoint variation through a state-of-the-art technique called
Data Augmentation.
